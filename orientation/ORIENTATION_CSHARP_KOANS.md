#DOTNET Core Koans
###What you will learn
####You will learn both the syntax of the C# language but also be learning who work with XUnit, a unit testing framework. The Koans uses failing tests to teach you how to make the tests pass while applying C# principles. 

Download the code from the following GitHub Repository: https://github.com/NotMyself/DotNetCoreKoans/tree/master/Koans

Unzip the code to a folder of your choosing.

Open Visual Studio code and go to File, Open Folder and select the folder where you placed the code.

Open the integrated terminal window by going to "View" on the menu then "Integrated Terminal".

1. At the Terminal Type: "dotnet restore"
2. Now type: "dotnet build" to build the application
3. Now type: "dotnet run" to run the application.

Refer to the ReadMe.md file that is contained in the solution if you have any issues. 

Make sure the integrated terminal window is tall enough to show you all of the messages. You should see message in the color red. 

You will need to find the function that is refered and fix the it so that the test passes. 

Each time you fix a test you will need to save the change, rebuild then run.

You must fix all of the asserts in order to complete the koans (Reach enlightenment)
