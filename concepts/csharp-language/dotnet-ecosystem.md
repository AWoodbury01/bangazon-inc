# .NET Overview

### .NET Core

Newest version of the .NET Framework that is open-source, cross-platform, and comes with a CLI tool. Most large scale employers haven’t started using .NET Core for their enterprise solutions, but don’t let that part scare you. 99% of what you learn will be the same as older versions of .NET.
