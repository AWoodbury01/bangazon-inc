## The Personal E-Commerce Platform

Bangazon Inc. welcomes you to the team. You've been selected from a deep pool of candidates to help build the next, disruptive online platform. Our goal is to become the most personalized, and most powerful commericial platform for individuals all around the globe.

You are needed to make that happen.

In order to become a profitable, and sustainable organization, we need you to build all of the technology and tooling for the company.

## Orientation

Your first two weeks on the job will be you orientation to the technical languages that you'll be using, and to the processes and procedures that you will need to follow to ensure high communication and high productivity for your team.

1. Installation of required tools.
1. Introduction to the language.
1. Concepts of sustainable, scalable, object-oriented software development.

1. Overview of server-side development ecosystem
1. How the Internet works

At the end of your orientation, you will be tasked with showing the management team the level of enlightenment that you have achieved for the basics. To do that, you will all, individually, work on the Koans of Elnightenment.

Your demonstration of Enlightenment will be used by your management team to determine which Development Team you will be assigned to for the next three months.

## Bangazon API

Once you have been assigned to your team, the entire team will build the initial version of the Bangazon Application Programming Interface. This API will be used by much of the rest of the platform, and by our customers to buy & sell products. You will use all of the Magical Abstractions and conventions that the development ecosystem provides to build the API.

As you build subsequent projects, you will learn much of the foundational technologies, tools and concepts that the Magical Abstrations do for you.

## Platform Development

Once all teams have built the initial version of the API, it will then be up to the team to determine which of the remaining projects will be built next. In fact, all the work that you do for the next three months will be determined by you and your teammates, collectively.

You may work on any project, in any order.

Once you have decided on a project, your management team will ensure that you have the proper training in the skills, concepts, and tools needed to complete the project, and then you will fulfill the requirements for the project until you are done, as defined in the [Bangazon Definition of Done](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-inc/blob/master/EMPLOYEE_HANDBOOK.md#definition-of-done).
