# Identity Framework

Identity Framework in .NET allows you to easily add authentication to your ASP.NET MVC application.

Follow the steps in the [Introduction to Identity on ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio) tutorial to see how easily you can create an application that has register, log in, and log out automatically scaffolded for you.

Once you complete that short tutorial, you should skip directly to the [Add custom user data to the Identity DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/add-user-data?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio#add-custom-user-data-to-the-identity-db) section to see how to _extend_ the basic **`IdentityUser`** model to add more information.
