# Displaying a List of Instructors

Use scaffolding to...

1. Create a `InstructorsController` in your controllers directory.
1. Create a `Views > Instructors` directory and use the scaffolding to the create the `Index`, `Details`, `Create`, `Edit`, and `Delete` views.
1. In your controller, use Dapper to execute SQL statements for all of those actions.

When you create or edit an instructor, you should be able to assign the instructor to a cohort from a `select` element in the form.
