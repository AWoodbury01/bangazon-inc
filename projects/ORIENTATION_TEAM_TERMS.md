# Commonly Used Software Development Team Terms

##The following list contains commonly used terms used by many software development teams. It is important that terms commonly used are understood by
all the team members. A common understanding greatly enhances communication and makes it easier to on-board new team members. 

####Continous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily. https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration

####Source Control
A version control system (also known as a Revision Control System) is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.

####GitFlow
Vincent Driessen's branching model is a git branching and release management strategy that helps developers keep track of features,
hotfixes and releases in bigger software projects. It is a commonly used branching strategy, the diagrams make it look more difficult 
that it really is. It is vital the teams sharing code have a branching strategy. A branching strategy protects production code, and protects team
members from damaging the code base. http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/

####Coding Standards
The following is from this source https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa291591(v=vs.71).aspx. A comprehensive coding standard encompasses all aspects of code construction. While developers should prudently implement a standard, it should be adhered to whenever practical. Completed source code should reflect a harmonized style, as if a single developer wrote the code in one session. At the inception of a software project, establish a coding standard to ensure that all developers on the project are working in concert. When the software project incorporates existing source code, or when performing maintenance on an existing software system, the coding standard should state how to deal with the existing code base.
The readability of source code has a direct impact on how well a developer comprehends a software system. Code maintainability refers to how easily that software system can be changed to add new features, modify existing features, fix bugs, or improve performance. Although readability and maintainability are the result of many factors, one particular facet of software development upon which all developers have an influence is coding technique. The easiest method to ensure a team of developers will yield quality code is to establish a coding standard, which is then enforced at routine code reviews.
Using solid coding techniques and good programming practices to create high-quality code plays an important role in software quality and performance. In addition, if you consistently apply a well-defined coding standard, apply proper coding techniques, and subsequently hold routine code reviews, a software project is more likely to yield a software system that is easy to comprehend and maintain.

####Code Reviews
Everyone at Bangazon will review code and have their code reviewed. It is important that coding standards are followed so code reviews can be most productive.Although the primary purpose for conducting code reviews throughout the development life cycle is to identify defects in the code, the reviews can also enforce coding standards in a uniform manner. Adherence to a coding standard is only feasible when followed throughout the software project from inception to completion. It is not practical, nor is it prudent, to impose a coding standard after the fact. 

####TDD (Test Driven Development)
Test driven development (TDD) is an software development approach in which a test is written before writing the code. Once the new code passes the test, it is refactored to an acceptable standard.
TDD ensures that the source code is thoroughly unit tested and leads to modularized, flexible and extensible code. It focuses on writing only the code necessary to pass tests, making the design simple and clear.

####Daily Standup
Development teams at Bangazon Inc. will schedule daily standups where progress is discuss as well as road blocks. Team members will answer the following questions:
 What did I accomplish yesterday?
 What will I do today?
 What obstacles are impeding my progress?
 Daily standups are usually limited to 15 minutes. If it discovered more discussion is needed, attendees make arrangements to discuss in more detail after the meeting.
####Sprints
 It is a short, consistent cycle no longer than four weeks. The goal is to have an iteration short enough to keep the team focused but long enough to deliver a meaningful increment of work.
####Sprint Reviews
In Scrum, each sprint is required to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. This means that at the end of each sprint, the team has produced a coded, tested and usable piece of software.
So at the end of each sprint, a sprint review meeting is held. During this meeting, the Scrum team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically this takes the form of a demo of the new features.

####Sprint Retrospectives
No matter how good a Scrum team is, there is always opportunity to improve. Although a good Scrum team will be constantly looking for improvement opportunities, the team should set aside a brief, dedicated period at the end of each sprint to deliberately reflect on how they are doing and to find ways to improve. This occurs during the sprint retrospective.
The sprint retrospective is usually the last thing done in a sprint. Many teams will do it immediately after the sprint review. The entire team, including both the ScrumMaster and the product owner should participate. You can schedule a scrum retrospective for up to an hour, which is usually quite sufficient. However, occasionally a hot topic will arise or a team conflict will escalate and the retrospective could take significantly longer.
